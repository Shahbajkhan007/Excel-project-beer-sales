# Excel-project-forecast-regression-beer-sales
The excel file includes beer retail sales data (Qc) over 52 weeks from January 1, 2015, to December 24, 2015. The variable Qc represents the total unit sales of the beer (six-packs, in cans, 72oz) across a large number of U.S. retailers. We will forecast future sales and asnwer business questions to help making business decisions.

1.  Report the sales data's mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and sample variance.

2.  Plot the sales data over time (week numbers), fit a linear trend line to these data and display the regression equation and the R2 for the trend line.

3.  Using the regression model above, predict the sales for the next period (next 52 weeks). Report the sale in a new column as "Trend forecast".

4.  Due to the fact that the above prediction does not account for seasonal fluctuations, the forecasting error may be significant (notice that sales are high in summer). Using the ratio-to-trend method, adjust seasonal fluctuations. To do this, follow the below procedure:

I. Predict the sales for the past weeks (Week 1 to 52) using the trend line in part 1.

II. Compute the actual to predicted sales ratio for all past weeks by dividing the given Qc by the predicted values for the same week. Report the ratio in a new column as "Differential ratio".

III. Calculate the quarterly average differential ratio (each 13 weeks comprise the one quarter). This is the ratio-to-trend adjustment. Include one data entry for each quarter in a new column with these findings (i.e., four data entries in total).

IV. To get the adjusted forecast, multiply the trend forecast for the first and the second 52 weeks by a corresponding quarterly ratio. Report your results in a new column as "Adjusted trend forecast".

V. Plot the adjusted trend forecast on the chart over time (week 1 to 104).

This report focuses on forecasting future sales of beer retail (Qc) based on historical data spanning 52 weeks. The data represents total unit sales of beer across multiple U.S. retailers. The objective is to develop an accurate sales forecast that considers both the overall trend and seasonal fluctuations.

The analysis begins with calculating key statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and sample variance. These measures provide insights into the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of the sales data.

A linear trend line is then fitted to the sales data over time, capturing the overall trend. The regression equation and R2 value of the trend line are determined to predict future sales.

Recognizing the impact of seasonal fluctuations, the ratio-to-trend method is employed. The past sales are predicted using the trend line, and the actual-to-predicted sales ratio is calculated. Quarterly average ratios are derived to adjust for seasonal variations.

The adjusted trend forecast is obtained by multiplying the trend forecast for the first and second 52 weeks by the corresponding quarterly ratios. The adjusted forecast provides a more accurate estimation of future sales.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the data analysis, forecasting methods, and results, facilitating informed decision-making for beer retail operations.


Based on the analysis of the beer retail sales data, several key findings have emerged. The mean sales value of 313.23077 indicates the average unit sales of beer across the U.S. retailers during the 52-week period. The median of 277 represents the middle value of the sales data, while the mode of 272 identifies the most frequently occurring sales figure.

The range of 391 signifies the spread between the highest and lowest sales values, providing insights into the variability of sales. The standard deviation of 104.67815 measures the dispersion of sales data around the mean, indicating the degree of variability in the dataset. 


In conclusion, while the trend line provides an estimation of future sales, it does not account for seasonal fluctuations. Therefore, the ratio-to-trend method is applied to adjust for these fluctuations and generate more accurate sales forecasts. This approach considers the historical sales patterns and provides quarterly ratios to refine the trend forecast, leading to improved sales predictions.

Overall, this analysis enhances our understanding of the beer retail market and offers valuable insights for effective sales forecasting and decision-making in the industry.
